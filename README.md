# bloc-jams

Bloc Jams is a digital music player like Spotify. This is the first project for the Bloc Frontend Course that teaches the foundations of web development. I started by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implemented interactivity with JavaScript.

Since the purpose of this project was to learn Javascript and jQuery's functionalities, the images and designs were given to me beforehand and only one album is available for viewing (album display looped in order to mimic a full album page). 

The deployed app can be viewed on my Heroku here: <a href="http://blocjamsjquery.herokuapp.com/">Link</a>
